# Micromouse
## Overview
Welcome to our Micromouse project repository. This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation related to our project, including PCB design files, reports, etc..

## Project Description
Our project involves designing the power subsystem and the sensing subsystem for the micromouse, which is essentially a maze-solving robot. We are focusing on designing the hardware components.

## Subsystems
### Power Subsystem
Responsible for powering and controlling the power supplied to the entire system, running the motors of the micromouse and charging the battery that powers the mouse.
### Sensing Subsystem
The sensor subsystem is responsible for detecting objects and ensuring that the micromouse maintains proper alignment within the maze pathways by sensing the walls around it.

The sensing subsystem folder contains all the necessary files and documentation for the design and implementation of the sensor subsystem. These being the datasheets of the non-passive components used, LaTeX and PDF design report, KiCad schematics and files, and the gerber files

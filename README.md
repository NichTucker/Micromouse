# Micromouse
## Overview
Welcome to our Micromouse project repository. This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation related to our project, including PCB design files, reports, etc..

## Project Description
Our project involves designing the power subsystem and the sensing subsystem for the micromouse, which is essentially a maze-solving robot. We are focusing on designing the hardware components.

## Subsystems
### Power Subsystem
Responsible for powering and controlling the power supplied to the entire system, running the motors of the micromouse and charging the battery that powers the mouse.
### Sensing Subsystem
Responsible for detecting/sensing objects in front and to the sides of the micromouse.

Micromouse
Overview
Welcome to our Micromouse project repository. This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation related to our project, including PCB design files, reports, etc..

Project Description
Our project involves designing the power subsystem and the sensing subsystem for the micromouse, which is essentially a maze-solving robot. We are focusing on designing the hardware components.

Subsystems
Power Subsystem
Responsible for powering the entire system, including running the motors and charging the battery

Sensing Subsystem
Responsible for detecting/sensing objects in front of the robot.
